# RAM model of computation

RAM stands for "Random Access Machine". RAM model of computation is a way of calculating the execution time of an algorithm by summing up the time taken by each operation of the algorithm.
In RAM model some operations are considered to be the elementary operations, these operations have constant run time. To calculate the total run time of an algorithm, you can add the run times of each elementary operation.

The operations that takes constant run time in RAM model are
1) Simple Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
2) Store and Load - When you assign any value in a variable that is an example of load operation. It is considered to be the elementary operation in this model.
3) Loops and conditionals - for loop, while loop, if-else conditionals.
4) Bit-shift.
